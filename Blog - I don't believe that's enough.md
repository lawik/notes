I worry that we are losing important parts of open source. It would not be surprising. I feel we are in the process of losing many good things and the world seems poised to be thrust into deep uncertainty in many different areas.

The community where my open source efforts sprout is the Elixir community. This has led me to do code, documentation, marketing and advocacy for Elixir along with interacting a lot with the wider community of Erlang and the BEAM. It has led me to send contributions to Buildroot for serving Nerves and variously poking my head out of my own community and over into others as it makes sense. And I've lived with free and open source software for a long time before I ever contributed.

I don't worry
