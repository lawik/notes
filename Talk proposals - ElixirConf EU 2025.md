## The unusual developments of NervesHub

A brief background on the NervesHub project and what it is.

Some of the historical baggage, what 2.0 did to change it and how we are improving beyond the 2.0.

Then a deeper dive on how the development process works. Some unusual needs as we developed the new Extensions feature. The mix of salaried employees, open source contributions and aspiring entrepreneurs.

This talk is about technical aspects around scaling, resiliency and some of the challenges of IoT but also fundamentally about open source development of a product on top of the technologies we enjoy. There is Phoenix, LiveView, Nerves & Ecto. Something for everyone.
