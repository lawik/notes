## The unusual developments of NervesHub

A brief background on the NervesHub project and what it is. Followed by the fantastic progress it is making.

First the historical baggage, what 2.0 did to change it and how we are improving beyond the 2.0.

Then a deeper dive on how the development process works. Some unusual needs as we developed the new Extensions feature. The mix of salaried employees, open source contributions and aspiring entrepreneurs. The importance of real customer feedback.

The commercial injection of resources required to achieve better UI.

This talk is about technical aspects around scaling, resiliency and some of the challenges of IoT but also fundamentally about open source development of a product on top of the technologies we enjoy. There is Phoenix, LiveView, Nerves & Ecto. Should have something for everyone.

## The Grand Kiosk - Machine Learning on Nerves

This talk would focus on a very hands-on implementation on top of Nerves with a real hardware device that you can buy and experiment with.

LiveView running as a kiosk, input options, machine-learning, multimedia processing through Membrane, networking and firmware updates.

Expect physical demos, sample code repos and a whirlwind tour of the important bits of the implementation. The goal is to enable Elixir developers to try audacious things with the building blocks our community lays out.
