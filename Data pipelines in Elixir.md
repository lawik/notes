A good example of a data pipeline.

- Podcast index data dump
- Pull RSS
- Stream MP3 to Transcription (slow work)
- Stream MP3 to Id3vx for metadata (mid-speed) work
- Process episode metadata and show notes (fast work)

Stack:

- Flow or Broadway
- Livebook in server env to access data/explore with Explorer
	- This actually seems quite complicated to get done
	- No on-server Livebook saving
	- No clear way to run the Livebook
	- Maybe VS Codium on the server is easier?
- How to allow using Python tools within the thing?
- What are nice abstractions for writing pipelines. Flow is a bit dense in itself.
