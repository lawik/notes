From https://nick-black.com/dankwiki/index.php/Book_list_for_streetfighting_computer_scientists

2022 edition. this is very different from most "best books for programmers" lists you'll see, with _Code Complete_ and _Clean Code_ and _Wistful Wanking for Practical Wankers_ and _Design Slatterns_ and titles like that. you'll figure all that out as you go along. these are books to read so that you can cut motherfuckers with knives. do you need to read all of these? only if you want to know the things inside, i guess.

speaking of math, you might want to take a look at Axler's _Linear Algebra Done Right_ and Knuth's _Concrete Mathematics_. you'll want to know your combinatorics, your prob/stats, and your linear algebra cold. calculus through diffeqs is necessary to know, but i'm a pretty hardcore nerd and yet don't find myself integrating things all that often.

now go forth and [fight in the streets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUt0dZXPFoU). i list no machine learning because i dislike machine learning. there are no quantum books because quantum is not yet useful for streetfighting (we all look forward to this situation changing). i list no SIMT/accelerator books because they're all shite. i list no infosec because infosec is a subfield of QA, fight me. there are no links because i'm a lazy, lazy man.

i've heard good things about Tim Roughgarden's algorithms books, and have them on my shelves to read soon, but cannot yet speak to them. likewise Beej's book on networking, though that looks kinda lightweight. neither he nor Stevens goes into modern [fast networking](https://nick-black.com/dankwiki/index.php/Fast_UNIX_Servers "Fast UNIX Servers") using things like [XDP](https://nick-black.com/dankwiki/index.php/XDP "XDP") and [Io_uring](https://nick-black.com/dankwiki/index.php/Io_uring "Io uring").
