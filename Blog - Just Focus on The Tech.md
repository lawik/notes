I am a heavily leftist tech-loving developer. There is a lot of activity in tech, open source and the world of the chronically online that is hard to balance and navigate. Progressiveness, liberalism, market liberals, accelerationism, technical optimism are all bringing their own weirdness.

I'm from Sweden. Liberal is a right-wing term here baking in a focus on the individual's freedom and usually comes with a lot of faith in The Market. Progressives are usually actual socialists (social democrats or otherwise, not usually communists) here. I will try to not use the word liberal incomprehensibly to an international readership.

The rise of the far right is comparatively simple inside of technical communities. They usually either keep their bad ideas to themselves and mostly get along or they go off the rails on a tirade and get booted. There are projects and communities where they let this madness stand, exist, even thrive. But that's not the norm. I think Trumpism, Q or whatever the current outlandish hate-filled thing is, doesn't usually sit well. But it is getting increasing cover.

Elon was once a bit less divisive. Or maybe I just didn't know very much about him. Opening Tesla's patents seemed like a cool move move way back when. He just seemed like someone doing cool things and innovating. Now he has gone way out right and seems generally unwell. He still occasionally cracks something about open source. Still talks tech though more and more fictionally. Plenty of people liked him as a somewhat progressive capitalist with high-tech ideas. And a lot of people that love The Market and a Strong Genius Leader really still gather under the Tesla flag. It becomes very identity and hard to back out from it seems.

I don't know if Elon really has any political or ideological beliefs. I think he is just completely gone out there. But others can probably analyse that better.

Similarly divisive but in a milder way is the Basecamp/37signals crew. DHH and Jason Fried got into the whole No Politics At Work thing and fired off a salvo in what turned into a larger beef with DEI. DEI being a progressive movement around trying to compensate for systemic inequality in the work force. I don't think either of them are racist or homophobic beyond the systemic baseline. Overall they've been quite progressive and that's what made this seem like a betrayal to a lot of folks.

They of course want to be Strong Opinionated Leaders and Make Hard Calls. In their case the call was to make it clear that they don't feel any responsibility to deal with systemic societal issues in the scope of their business. They got uncomfortable with the hard, nuanced process that successful DEI entails and they decided to yeet it. It is no longer a work problem. I bet they have friends in marginalised groups. They are just opting out of that responsibility.

Just opting out. Not actually all that hard of a call I'm afraid. This is very easy to do as a person in a position of great privilege. Me, personally, I don't have almost anything speaking against me in the market, at work, at play. I'm welcome everywhere and have a lot of options. My default is the world's default. I could opt out of hard conversations. I could leave my politics and ideology at the door and just get along. Just talk tech. That's easy. I like tech. I get along with almost anyone when we talk tech.

Not everyone has that ease of opting out. Not talking politics at work means not sharing their life. Not arguing for themselves. It means quietly accepting that they play the game with weight gear on.

Meritocracy is bullshit. Technocracy is bullshit. We can't do that. As a society, as people, as a social animal. We all know politicians don't understand tech well enough to govern it. And the experts they consult are whoever talks a good game of politics.

We know Sam Altman is a good talker with no moral foundation. We know the best does not bubble to the top. The psychos do. And for people you once liked that bubble to the top they may well end up turning more and more to being a Strong Leader and Making Hard Calls.

DHH is not wrong in everything. His recent dive into anti-cloud is something I could get behind if he hadn't burned my trust. For someone who finds politics in the workplace a nuisance, he just scored double points.

It is okay to not want to be politically active in the workplace. Many people have kind of crap politics, sometimes they even inherited their politics and didn't examine them. Often their politics are individualistic and ego-centric and they know they don't come across well when discussed in the open. This has been a part of the conservative right forever. You can discuss taxation. But you don't talk about the money, you don't talk very much about politics. It is not civil, it is not polite. Probably because it makes you look bad when your priorities lay bare.

For conservatives: money, resistance to change, minimal disruption of my current station.

For liberals/libertarians: money, individual freedoms, minimal disruption of my current station.

If everyone is free to do their thing very little will change. Disruption in startup terms is usually just continued pressure on the working class to funnel money upwards.

The left is not usually so concerned about sharing their political ideas because they don't sound callous, awful and greedy. They are about enabling the collective, raising the baseline, improving shared resources. The ways in which people have tainted it in the past is to claim that it is inefficient or that it wastes resources on the undeserving.
