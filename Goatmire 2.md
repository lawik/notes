## Exclusive speaking

Fewer speakers. Harder criteria. Pay speakers.

Criteria for established speakers:
Talks to reference and review.
Require two reference endorsements, someone to vouch for the value of what the speaker offers in some way.

Criteria for new speakers:
Different.. maybe anonymous.

Have an intentional mix of these.

Sponsor-collaborating speakers?

Other approach:
Completely anonymous application process.

## Hack sessions

A few different libraries with issues prepped and ready to go. X number of libraries participate. They get 5 minutes each to explain/pitch what they want help with.

Then attendees get to break out and work with them. For a sessio .

## Showcase sessions

Similar to hack sessions but instead of hacking on the library, the maintainer does a brief type of training/intro/talk pushing their thing.
