- What we are doing now wouldn't get us here
- MVP is not how you solve fundamental problems
- Iteration is not how revolutionize

I don't know quite where I'm going here. But it used to be the case that applications were written for an OS. It used to be the case that people thought about overarching philosophies of computing (The UNIX philosophy, how the Mac OS:es have worked, how Windows has worked).

Now we have "apps" like Slack and Discord looking the same everywhere.

Is this a paradigm shift where the new system is "look the same everywhere, ignore the OS". And what is that solving? My sense is that it focuses on "business value" more than sound design.
