NAT traversal seems possible but tricky and being in the middle would likely be simpler

Traversing the NAT would be more efficient and cooler. And would scale in an awesome way

See "what if I don't want multiple interfaces?" https://jrs-s.net/2018/08/05/routing-between-wg-interfaces-with-wireguard/

Should mean one interface per " private. network "
