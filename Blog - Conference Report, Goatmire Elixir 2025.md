The quiet was unsettling. The lack of concrete things to do was stressful. Me and my wife had been fretting and flitting around the house for most of the day making sure everything was staged, that we had the various prints, checklists were ready, lots of bags and boxes were packed.

The event has now happened. Results are in. I am very satisfied. This is my conference report, as the organizer. Because of my deep level of involvement it may end up being quite a long post.

## Conception

I can't put a date to how long we've prepared for the conference. But about 6 months at increasing intensity. I picked up the bug of wanting to run and event when I visited Gig City Elixir in Chattanooga in May 2024. All credit to Maggie and Bruce Tate for that. A few things really made it a brain bug back then. Todd Resudek offered that I could freely use the NervesConf name to run an EU event. Very kind and I definitely want to gather the EU Nerves community. And when I chatted with folks about running something in Sweden they seemed optimistic. Andrea Leopardi of Elixir core team fame confirmed himself as my first speaker then and there.

It probably took most shape during the first quarter of this year (2025). The name, sourced from a historic name for Varberg, Getakärr, can be fairly translated to Goatmire. It was distinctive. My particular sense of humor would be a guiding blight through the process.

There were a few things that confirmed it for us. Talking to some of the people around the Varberg tech hub [Techarenan](https://varbergtech.se/techarena/) I got in touch with the public sector commerce folks and they were very enthusiastic and gave me a warm introduction to Sparbanksstiftelsen. This is a foundation that owns Varbergs Sparbank, the local bank. They reinvest in the local area and after some conversation we sent a suggestion, a rough budget and applied for a stipend.

It took a minute to confirm but the year was very young when we got our base funding from them confirmed. Then we started spinning up the non-profit registration. Gathered recommendations for venues and talked to them. In the end landing on Varbergs Teater, the theatre where me and my wife married, because it seems the most interesting and the most flexible to custom ideas. There are many good venues in this little city since it is a swedish tourist-destination but I wanted something with a lot of character and I knew the theatre could deliver.

Some basic funding and a venue meant we had a starting point.

## Event architecture

One day NervesConf EU for IoT with Elixir and two days Goatmire Elixir for regular Elixir. I wanted to make the event distinct. I don't think we actually gave a ton of guidance to speakers towards that. The most relevant bit from the CFP was:

"We will not be taking on talks that are "Update on project X" but are fine with talks that involve new features and either how they were built or what they allowed you to do. Avoid presenting a changelog. Teach something, tell a story, blow some minds or show your work."

I wanted to do wild things but I'm also new at making events and didn't want to make my first time completely impossible. I didn't push for people to take exceptionally bold swings in the CFP but in every conversation I ended up encouraging the more interesting choice at every turn.

Importantly I'd heard the great things people had to say about EMPEX and The Big Elixir. A single track conference in a theater will be a very focused affair. I had some faith that we could deliver something similar though we are decidedly not New Orleans or New York.

3 days, the first probably smaller, single track. That's the rough of it.

## Building it up

I had a single speaker so I started reaching out to my network to pin people down. The Nerves core team for NervesConf, good collaborators for more Nerves talks. Some solid names for the Elixir days of the event.

The procedure for getting sponsors was similar. Tap my network, both the local one in Varberg and the one in I have in Elixir. My sponsor journey went pretty well overall. I had a late plot twist of a sponsor pulling out shortly before payment was due but someone picked up the mantle quickly after.

At some point I launched the waiting list. We estimated we could deal with 150 people. The waiting list climbed to 90 people very quickly. Over time it drifted up to 200 before we launched tickets. If there is something I've worked up a muscle for in the last 7-8 years it is "marketing". That is, I am already actively posting on socials. I have a newsletter. I have a podcast. I know other people with podcasts.

The appetite for a community-run less-commercial Elixir event was definitely there and another one popped up essentially in parallel with AlchemyConf in Braga, Portugal. But they were in March, we were targeting September. I had already decided on the theater when they announced their own (larger, fancier, but less cozy?) theater. They were first on using Discord as a conference app though. I jacked that from them.

Over time design, ideas and concepts started to crystallize. The pre-CFP line-up looked great. The CFP made it fantastic with some help from the program committee I recruited. The event gained steam. And speakers kept getting back to me with weird (awesome) ideas and requests which pleased me to now end. Gus Workman and I conspired to do something with hardware. He did all the work, I found the money.

## The day before the day before

The emptiness was heavy. I felt like I had missed something. Everything.

The Discord was popping with people travelling, making board game plans and announcing their arrivals to the swedish west coast. And I had an errand to run. It was both practical and an excuse for me to say hi to some people. We literally didn't have more we could do at this point. Very close to "go time" but many hours until we could pull any triggers.

I shoved a bunch of Nerves hardware into the car and drove into the city (I live in the countryside). I would stash it in Gus' room until he arrived and could deal with it (oh, how he would have to deal with it ...). Three boxes of devices with less-than-good 3D-printed cases and one full box of actually good 3D printed cases. For 200 devices.

Parking outside the speaker hotel, Gästis, I wrangled boxes in there and went to the reception desk. As I waited a bit for the receptionist I spotted a group of 6 or 7 familiar faces. From memory it was Frank Hunleth, Rebecca Le, Jonatan Männchen, Pascal C, Srinivas Ganti and Dan Janowski. Pascal was the only new acquaintance and he was subsequently everywhere. They helped me stash the boxes in Gus' room and I had already cleared permission with Stina (my wife) to grab dinner in town with people. So we acquired a Josh Price and a Sam Aaron at minimum before we sauntered out to find some swedish-style pizza for the weary travelers.

I went home shortly after the pizza, more people accrued as we ate. I got to say hit to Flora and Tom Petterson who both played a massive part in making the event memorable.
## Setup & Speaker's Day

The day before the conference started was planned for setup. We had access to the venue from 12-16 to rig stuff. Then we had plans with the speakers of the event from 16 into the evening. Me and my wife absolutely stuffed the car with stuff, including the plywood goat, drove into town. Parked at the venue and went for food.

Srinivas was a champ who showed up immediately for the prep though he wasn't even originally a volunteer. He just wanted to help and that he did. After a while Flora and Tom rolled in and started the wildest testing for their talk. When the grand piano and the old-school overhead projector gets involved that's when you know shit got real.

Zach Daniel showed up to test his talk which required some special effects. A few others also came to test, help and so on. Badges, lanyards and shirts were prepped. Plans were made. Roll-ups placed. Some was tested and then removed because there was an event that evening that used some of the venue.

An extra wifi-network was added for Nerves-devices. Would it be sufficient? It never is.
