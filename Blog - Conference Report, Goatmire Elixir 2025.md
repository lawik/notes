The quiet was unsettling. The lack of concrete things to do was stressful. Me and my wife had been fretting and flitting around the house for most of the day making sure everything was staged, that we had the various prints, checklists were ready, lots of bags and boxes were packed.

The event has now happened. Results are in. I am very satisfied. This is my conference report, as the organizer. Because of my deep level of involvement it may end up being quite a long post.

## Conception

I can't put a date to how long we've prepared for the conference. But about 6 months at increasing intensity. I picked up the bug of wanting to run and event when I visited Gig City Elixir in Chattanooga in May 2024. All credit to Maggie and Bruce Tate for that. A few things really made it a brain bug back then. Todd Resudek offered that I could freely use the NervesConf name to run an EU event. Very kind and I definitely want to gather the EU Nerves community. And when I chatted with folks about running something in Sweden they seemed optimistic. Andrea Leopardi of Elixir core team fame confirmed himself as my first speaker then and there.

It probably took most shape during the first quarter of this year (2025). The name, sourced from a historic name for Varberg, Getakärr, can be fairly translated to Goatmire. It was distinctive. My particular sense of humor would be a guiding blight through the process.

There were a few things that confirmed it for us. Talking to some of the people around the Varberg tech hub [Techarenan](https://varbergtech.se/techarena/) I got in touch with the public sector commerce folks and they were very enthusiastic and gave me a warm introduction to Sparbanksstiftelsen. This is a foundation that owns Varbergs Sparbank, the local bank. They reinvest in the local area and after some conversation we sent a suggestion, a rough budget and applied for a stipend.

It took a minute to confirm but the year was very young when we got our base funding from them confirmed. Then we started spinning up the non-profit registration. Gathered recommendations for venues and talked to them. In the end landing on Varbergs Teater, the theatre where me and my wife married, because it seems the most interesting and the most flexible to custom ideas. There are many good venues in this little city since it is a swedish tourist-destination but I wanted something with a lot of character and I knew the theatre could deliver.

Some basic funding and a venue meant we had a starting point.

## Event architecture

One day NervesConf EU for IoT with Elixir and two days Goatmire Elixir for regular Elixir. I wanted to make the event distinct. I don't think we actually gave a ton of guidance to speakers towards that. The most relevant bit from the CFP was:

"We will not be taking on talks that are "Update on project X" but are fine with talks that involve new features and either how they were built or what they allowed you to do. Avoid presenting a changelog. Teach something, tell a story, blow some minds or show your work."

I wanted to do wild things but I'm also new at making events and didn't want to make my first time completely impossible. I didn't push for people to take exceptionally bold swings in the CFP but in every conversation I ended up encouraging the more interesting choice at every turn.

Importantly I'd heard the great things people had to say about EMPEX and The Big Elixir. A single track conference in a theater will be a very focused affair. I had some faith that we could deliver something similar though we are decidedly not New Orleans or New York.

3 days, the first probably smaller, single track. That's the rough of it.

## Building it up

I had a single speaker so I started reaching out to my network to pin people down. The Nerves core team for NervesConf, good collaborators for more Nerves talks. Some solid names for the Elixir days of the event.

The procedure for getting sponsors was similar. Tap my network, both the local one in Varberg and the one in I have in Elixir. My sponsor journey went pretty well overall. I had a late plot twist of a sponsor pulling out shortly before payment was due but someone picked up the mantle quickly after.

At some point I launched the waiting list. We estimated we could deal with 150 people. The waiting list climbed to 90 people very quickly. Over time it drifted up to 200 before we launched tickets. If there is something I've worked up a muscle for in the last 7-8 years it is "marketing". That is, I am already actively posting on socials. I have a newsletter. I have a podcast. I know other people with podcasts.

The appetite for a community-run less-commercial Elixir event was definitely there and another one popped up essentially in parallel with AlchemyConf in Braga, Portugal. But they were in March, we were targeting September. I had already decided on the theater when they announced their own (larger, fancier, but less cozy?) theater. They were first on using Discord as a conference app though. I jacked that from them.

Over time design, ideas and concepts started to crystallize. The pre-CFP line-up looked great. The CFP made it fantastic with some help from the program committee I recruited. The event gained steam. And speakers kept getting back to me with weird (awesome) ideas and requests which pleased me to now end. Gus Workman and I conspired to do something with hardware. He did all the work, I found the money.

## The day before the day before

The emptiness was heavy. I felt like I had missed something. Everything.

The Discord was popping with people travelling, making board game plans and announcing their arrivals to the swedish west coast. And I had an errand to run. It was both practical and an excuse for me to say hi to some people. We literally didn't have more we could do at this point. Very close to "go time" but many hours until we could pull any triggers.

I shoved a bunch of Nerves hardware into the car and drove into the city (I live in the countryside). I would stash it in Gus' room until he arrived and could deal with it (oh, how he would have to deal with it ...). Three boxes of devices with less-than-good 3D-printed cases and one full box of actually good 3D printed cases. For 200 devices.

Parking outside the speaker hotel, Gästis, I wrangled boxes in there and went to the reception desk. As I waited a bit for the receptionist I spotted a group of 6 or 7 familiar faces. From memory it was Frank Hunleth, Rebecca Le, Jonatan Männchen, Pascal C, Srinivas Ganti and Dan Janowski. Pascal was the only new acquaintance and he was subsequently everywhere. They helped me stash the boxes in Gus' room and I had already cleared permission with Stina (my wife) to grab dinner in town with people. So we acquired a Josh Price and a Sam Aaron at minimum before we sauntered out to find some swedish-style pizza for the weary travelers.

I went home shortly after the pizza, more people accrued as we ate. I got to say hit to Flora and Tom Petterson who both played a massive part in making the event memorable.
## Setup & Speaker's Day

The day before the conference started was planned for setup. We had access to the venue from 12-16 to rig stuff. Then we had plans with the speakers of the event from 16 into the evening. Me and my wife absolutely stuffed the car with stuff, including the plywood goat, drove into town. Parked at the venue and went for food.

Srinivas was a champ who showed up immediately for the prep though he wasn't even originally a volunteer. He just wanted to help and that he did. After a while Flora and Tom rolled in and started the wildest testing for their talk. When the grand piano and the old-school overhead projector gets involved that's when you know shit got real

Zach Daniel showed up to test his talk which required some special effects. A few others also came to test, help and so on. Badges, lanyards and shirts were prepped, thoroughly optimized by Dan J, executed by Helene (our lovely hired gun for event know-how) and Srinivas. Plans were made. Roll-ups placed. Some was set up and then torn down again because there was an event that evening that used some of the venue.

An extra wifi-network was added for Nerves-devices. Would it be sufficient? Of course not. It never is.

Essentially setup went super. The tech, Tobias is an absolute mensch. What a solid presence. I also can't recommend dealing with a theater enough. Where a conference venue will go "You want to do WHAT?" a venue like this will go "Typical thursday, sounds good. Need lights or smoke with that?".

Right before 16 o' clock me and Stina left the venue to get drinks and snacks to [Kallbadhuset](https://kallbadhuset.se](https://kallbadhuset.se/)) (The Cold Bath House) where the first speaker social event was. Sauna and a swim in the ocean, rince and repeat. Good way to break the ice. People are various level of comfortable, makes for fun conversation. Good view. Nice old place. Not everyone attended this but it wa a good time and a good start. And then we sauntered over to the restaurant, NAMI. Japanese fusion tapas, something. Good place.

I was already very happy. Seeing some of my best community friends drift around my town, come to the experiences I chose, definitely bringing a smile to my lips. Watching the speakers gather, most of who I already know from the community. What a feeling. With some extra friends included we were around 36 people for dinner. Food was great. People had a great time connecting, reconnecting and so on. Then we drifted over to the bar for a bit.

That was a slight mistake on my part.

## Day 1: NervesConf EU

I did end up staying out a bit longer and having a few more drinks than I had planned so I was definitely not at optimal energy when I dragged myself out of my hotel room bed around 6.15 in the morning. We slept in the hotel to not have the travel time and the kids were with my in-laws which was a life-saver. Sleeping through the night without bonus dialogue was a big win.

Get into outfit #1, trashy, my most worn metal shirt, the authentically worn-through jeans, studded belt, keychain, Converse All-Star, red plaid shirt. Throwback to my teens. Underscoring the informality of the event. Breakfast at hotel. Get to venue, setup from 7-8, doors at 8, seating area open from 8.30. Start at 9.

Great start. It starts on [this video](https://youtu.be/QOdd3Ya6qlY?si=7aRU04ULX-JMkwBj). Then Marc Lainez is off and delivering a talk on The Nerves Car project. An audacious electric mod to a WV Polo using a variety of Nissa Leaf, Tesla and other parts. Brains with Nerves, UI with Flutter and tons more interesting detail. I was probably still mildly hung over but at some point I just forgot about that.

All talks were recorded and the absolute majority will be released.

Then we are off. I won't go blow by blow. I loved so many of the talks and I think everyone put their best foot forward. I'm very pleased that my starting strategy worked. Cold open. The initial keynote speaker welcomes the crowd with their presentation. As the MC I spoke after. Kicking off the event when it was already in full swing. Having earned some of the space to talk about sponsors and what the logistics of the day look like.

I also tried not to close on logistics. "Don't open or close on logistics." is one of my big takeaways from The Art of Gathering by Priya Parker. Love that book. During this day I did say a few words to wrap up the day after the last speaker, Damir Batanovic, had impressed us thoroughly with his drone and video shenanigans, but I had handled the end logistics earlier.

(TODO: links for Gus' projects)
In the middle, something to mention, is that Gus Workman gave his talk. And every attendee in the audience had one of his Wisteria devices. A special eInk board based on his Trellis design. We hadn't gotten the batteries yet but if you plugged it in to USB-C power, it totally worked. He told the story of the device, pretty awesome. The project of getting these devices was real tight to deadlines and Gus pulled an enormous workload to do it (on his own volition), may it bring him great business.

If there was one thing that didn't go at all as planned it was the badge hack session during this day. It was fine. We covered the state of things, Gus shared more about how it worked. But it was planned to be more workshop and hacking. It didn't turn out that way because we hadn't had enough stuff prepared. It was the most shit-show thing of the entire day and it was .. fine. Alright enough.

MC:ing felt smooth enough. I even got a chant going for Frank Hunleth and got to introduce him as if he were a pro fighter. I got really comfortable with the role of MC:ing, dealing with the occasional HDMI issue.

Feedback from the first day was very positive. I went to my hotel room, I showered, I tried to rest. I failed. I revised MC notes to update them with some missing details for the next days. Then I went to the bar for a little bit, got to hang with the people and catch the good mood. I had a single beer and was in bed by eleven. I slept well and was in good shape next day.

## Day 2: Goatmire Elixir starts

Outfit. Very fancy. Cravat, waistcoat, blazer styled like old furniture. This time to show people that we are taking it up a notch. Pack extra outfit and lots of gear because this is the weird start. Breakfast. At the venue from 7.10 probably. Attendees get in at 8. We kick off at 9.

In the green room (another perk of operating in a theater) activity is frantic and fun. Zach Daniel has tapped me, Sasa Juric, Shannon and Parker Selbert into speaking roles in his keynote. And then on top of that a whole Ash ensemble of Josh Price, Rebecca Le, James Harton and Barnabas Jovanovics. We are all outfitting ourselves. This talk is weird.

I'll spoil it a bit. He does not actually announce a new Ash library. But he does break the timeline. One after another we bring him the stories of broken timelines related to the Elixir ecosystem.

It was a whole thing.

It was also another cold open. I end up needing to MC in my future post-apocalyptic time traveler kit for a bit as I kick off the day and lead us into the next thing. Then I hurry off to get fancy again.

From the day before I have the feeling down for how talks go for me as the organizer. I start off on stage introducing the speaker, I make sure they get rolling and possibly help with HDMI or stalling for time. Once rolling, I leave and go check on things and let some of the nervous energy out. Rinse and repeat.

Many great talks through the day. The sense of excitement and fun among the attendees was fantastic. We eventually received the Wisteria batteries and handed those out. The devices were not just for NervesConf. *Everyone got one.* The mood was stellar.

Towards the end I gave a few notes, talked a bit of logistics. And then handed things off to Sasa Juric for the last iteration of the year of the talk he has been touring that has not yet been released on video. Some say we got the best version. Tell Me a Story.

It was sublime. I was riveted. When the Erlangelist asks you for 55 minute slot to present a three act monodrama you give it to him. When he asks for a skull you order the skull. And then he will enrapture your crowd and grab a standing ovation on his way out.

The energy of this evening was wild. I've never had so many people thank me in my life. I've never had so many people tell me about my own event in bewildered excitement. I could not be smiling more.

Partially I was smiling because I was one of three people among the nearly 200 involved that knew how the next day starts.

One beer. Maybe two. In bed at a reasonable hour.

## Day 3: Goatmire Elixir ends

Breakfast. Other fancy outfit, darker, more somber.
