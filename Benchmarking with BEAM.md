I would love to see how assorted fun devices perform on BEAM benchmarks.

## Benchmarks

- [estone & friends](https://github.com/fhunleth/beam_benchmarks) via Frank's repo. They run a bunch of benchmarks, I don't get a sense of how useful that output is. My M2 Macbook Air gets more estones than my 5950X but takes 0.2 seconds more. What does that mean?


## Devices to try

- My desktop (Ryzen 5950X, yadda-yadda)
- M1 Mac Mini
- M2 Macbook Air
- Steam Deck (need to compile Erlang)

## Gotchas

Erlang compilation fails via asdf on Steam Deck. Should compile manually. Should also learn to compile it well on MacOS because kerl/asdf and my Air have not been friends.
