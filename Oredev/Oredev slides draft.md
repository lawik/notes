# Erlang & The BEAM  runtime

- Trade-offs are inherent in language design
	- Ruby & Python give up performance for expressiveness
	- Java & .Net, shines nowhere, generic, complex
	- JavaScript & V8, sensitive concurrency model
- Erlang was designed for
	- Concurrent operation
	- Consistently low latencies
	- High availability & robustness
	- Hot code updates

## The Erlang Way

- Created at Ericsson
- Open sourced by a fluke of destiny (via Jane Walerud)
- Large amounts of lightweight "processes"
- Message passing
- Supervision trees
