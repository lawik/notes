- a special purpose editor
- Text-editing is a fallback mode for broken and non-elixir files
- with Elixir it should offer structured editing
- Should work off of partial AST for unfinished modules or when the project can't launch
- Should be able to work off of a running beam instance and introspection otherwise
- Navigation sidebar navigates module structures first, offers file tree fallback
- Interactively offer tracing?
- Connect to running beam instances as well (loses saving)
