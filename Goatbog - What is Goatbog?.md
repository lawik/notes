Goatbog is a lifestyle. Goatbog is a movement. Goatbog is a f√∂rening. The Goatbog was inside you all along.

Effluvium aside we are a small organisation that does cool tech things in Varberg.

Not make happen. Not inspire. Not influence. Only do.

If we do and it does not make the thing happen we clearly did not actually do.
If we do and it does not inspire it clearly was not cool.
If we do and it does not influence .. check and make sure it was in Varberg..?

Goatbog is hands on with tech. Our tech stinks of solder smoke, signal integrity, hex dumps, smashed stacks and heaps of memory.

We share, teach, hack and experiment. The way to punch harder than anyone expects is to be sharp. Never dull.

If you want cool tech things in your life. You can Goatbog. If you are not a bad person and willing to put in work for it. You are Goatbog. Technically you also have to apply. But in principle.

Goatbog happens here. Goatbog pulls from everywhere.
