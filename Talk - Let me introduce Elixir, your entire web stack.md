COLD OPEN.

I am here to tell you about a stack that has the productivity- and developer-focus of Ruby with Rails. In contrast to Ruby it is quite performant. It brings trivial concurrency and parallellism that blows Node JS out of the water. It is a high-level language working at an expressive abstraction level. In the ecosystem we have an opinionated web framework with great performance and productivity, a darling of the startup world. A clear and productive database layer that prevents SQL injection at compile time. A clean and friendly frontend web UI solution that is similar to Vue JS and leaves React in the dust.

It is your completely normal web dev but better at every step.

Built on a almost 40 year old (TODO: Verify) foundation of Swedish innovation it has deep roots and high branches.

Oh. And it makes it trivial to do realtime, use audio and video, run machine learning inference and it simplifies your infrastructure. There is also a great IoT framework.

I'm Lars Wikman. I run a site and company called Underjord.io. Let me tell you about Elixir.

TRANSITION; BREATHER

I just made a ton of claims and I want to address them all in turn to underline that I'm not actually blowing smoke or throwing unwarranted hype around. A good first step is to share my credentials.

Self-taught web dev.
Through Perl, PHP, JavaScript and Python I got into Elixir.
I've worked professionally with Elixir for four years, used it for six.
I have learned it, used it, taught it, recruited for it and contributed to it in various way.

It is not the most well-known or widely used language. But it is a much appreciated and growing contender according to what I've seen and surveys.

It is fine to take everything about me and what I say with a pinch of salt. I'm an enthusiastic person. It's fine.

Alright. Lets back some claims.

## The runtime, Erlang & the BEAM

When building a programming language runtime you make design choices that enshrine trade-offs.

- Ruby & Python, high-level, elegant language, dynamic, mutable and very flexible. Dog slow, terrible concurrency.
- Java & .Net, everything plus the kitchen sink. General, generic, safe. Okay everywhere, exceptional nowhere. Fast, due to immense investment.
- Javascript's V8, high single-thread performance, cooperative multi-threading, fast if IO-bound. Very sensitive to CPU-bound work. Fast, due to immense investment.

Erlang, the Ericsson language, was built to be a high-level, opinionated language for solving hard problems in the telecom space. The requirements were, consistently low latency, high availability, soft realtime, live code updates, reliability and robustness. Concurrency and parallellism came later as a consequence of designing for this. It also provides immense possibilities at runtime, in production.

The BEAM virtual machine has proven itself over and over again, at Ericsson, Whatsapp, Blizzard, Riot Games and many, many more. It can run millions of lightweight processes and easily distribute workloads across a global cluster.

Erlang has been a nice language and the secret sauce of many cool products and projects. It never achieved wide public popularity.

The BEAM VM is performant, by design, without massive investment. Ask the Erlang/OTP team how many they are compared to the JVM folks.

## The language, Elixir

Built by a Rubyist, JosÃ© Valim, looking for something more performant. Elixir is very reminiscent to Ruby at the surface level. One layer deeper than syntax you quickly find it is a high-level, dynamic, functional programming language. Precisely like Erlang but a fair bit more approachable. I covers skmilar ground to Clojure but with a different foundation.

TODO: Optimize code sample

```elixir

@doc """
Take the popular combination of a first name and a last name. Produes a full name in the typical style.

### Examples

  iex> to_fullname("Lars ", "Wikman")
  "Lars Wikman"
  iex> to_fullname("Lars", "Wikman", true)
  "LARS WIKMAN"

"""
def to_fullname(firstname, lastname, airport_mode? \\ false) do
	[firstname, lastname]
	|> Enum.map(fn name ->
		name
		|> String.trim()
		|> then(fn name ->
		  if airport_mode? do
			  String.upcase(name)
		  else
			  String.capitalize(name)
		  end
		end)
	end)		
	|> Enum.join(" ")
end

```

## The ecosystem of Elixir

As a modern language there is great package management and sweet tooling.

- Mix - Project generation, build tooling and more
- Hex - Dependency management, used through mix (TODO: IMAGES for hex.pm and hexdocs)
- ExUnit - Testing (TODO: IMAGE)
- ExDoc - Documentation & examples as doctests (TODO: IMAGE)

## Actor model, supervision trees & more

We have no time to cover the fundamentals of how Erlang achieves reliability. Suffice to say it has a very significant and well-respected legacy. Elixir inherits that foundation and uses it for everything. It is a fundamental part of the language and runtime.

## Phoenix - The Web Framework

The Phoenix web framework was built by another rubyist. Chris Mccord (TODO: spelling). He spent a ton of time in Ruby trying to build something that abstracted doing live and realtime web UI in a simple way. It was really slow and difficult.

He jumped at the opportunity of working with a more performant language with a similar approach.

They started with fundamentals so we essentially have an MVC framework that most web devs will find familiar. Thanks to Erlang it is highly concurrent and parallel. It has highly optimized templating which means server-side rendering is really fast. It also does really well as an API.

They quickly built an abstraction for doing more realtime things and exposing the Actor model more cleanly to the web browser. Phoenix Channels. At this time they ran a benchmarking pushing the Phoenix WebSocket support to find the limits. The process is covered in a good blog post. They hit 2 million concurrent active websockets on a single beefy box.

In a recent move for simplicity there is no longer any Node or NPM by default. Instead it ships esbuild and Tailwind CSS as syandalone binaries. You can change this fairly easily as well, nothing ia deeply integrated.

All in all a fundamentally very strong web framework. This is just the beginning.

Time to get serious.

## Phoenix LiveView

A full stack paradigm which covers 90% of use-cases by putting the server first and pushing the Actor model all the way to the edge. With real functional programming and immutability, highly optimized templates and diffing you get a fully interactive web app while only writing Elixir code.

A simple design that covers immense ground. A LiveView marries a small Javascript library, a WebSocket and a server-side Actor that holds state. This allows us to leverage the runtime's immense capabilities with managing state ans operating concurrently. We retain near-realtime latency. It spares us from maintaining layers of API and building out a full-fledged frontend app in some other framework.

This is time to market. This is good beating out perfect. This is velocity and shipping. Keep It Simple Stupid. This is doing less. Leveraging a powerful runtime and well-designed frameworks.

But the devil is in the details right?
It is not for offline-first. It is not for super-intense interactivity.
But you can mix it with other approaches as well.

And it grows beyond the prototype. It has components, slots and all the things you would expect from a frontend framework. It has a file upload implementation to die for.

Even being still pre-1.0 it is seeing heavy use throughout the community.

And you don't have to write Javascript. But you can and there are escape hatches and integration points for what you need to get done.

## Builder stack

This is a web stack by builders for builders. I've been to ElixirConf. It is dominated by people who use the language and framework to get stuff done.

FP without pretention. A replacement for your Ruby, your Python, your Node.js that can do multiple things at the same time. And a web framework which gives you as much abstraction as it can with minimal weird magic. Simply building on top of the powerful abstractions that escaped Ericsson in the 80's (TODO: verify).

A community that has spawned, grown and progressed without a megacorp at the helm. An ecosystem that is stable and where code rarely churns or changes. A language that was considered generally done several years ago.

This is how you make something different.
